   \class PMTPulseRecoBase
   The base class of pulse reconstruction algorithms. All algorithms should inherit from this calss
   to be executed by a manager class, pulse_reco. Note that this class does not depend on the rest
   of the framework except for the use of constants. In order to reconstruct a pulse, all it requires
   is a std::vector<short> type object (i.e. raw waveform), waveform pedestal, and its standard
   deviation. All of these are to be provided by an executer. Reconstructed pulse parameters are
   stored in the pulse_param struct object.

   All methods specified as "virtual" should be implemented by the inherit children class.

   This class provides some basic std::vector calculation algorithms such as integral, derivative,
   max and min algorithms. Inherit children classes are encouraged to use these provided methods
   when possible.
